              Mechanisms by which specific histone modifications regulate distinct gene networks remain little understood. We investigated how H3K79me2, a modification catalyzed by DOT1L and previously considered a general transcriptional activation mark, regulates gene expression during cardiogenesis. Embryonic cardiomyocyte ablation of
              Dot1l
              revealed that H3K79me2 does not act as a general transcriptional activator, but rather regulates highly specific transcriptional networks at two critical cardiogenic junctures: embryonic cardiogenesis, where it was particularly important for left ventricle-specific genes, and postnatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal, with Dot1L mutants having more mononuclear cardiomyocytes and prolonged cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity. Mechanistic analyses revealed that H3K79me2 in two distinct domains, gene bodies and regulatory elements, synergized to promote expression of genes activated by DOT1L. Surprisingly, H3K79me2 in specific regulatory elements also contributed to silencing genes usually not expressed in cardiomyocytes. These results reveal mechanisms by which DOT1L successively regulates left ventricle specification and cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal.},
